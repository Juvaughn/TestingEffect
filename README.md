# TestingEffect
It is said that memory retrieval often enhances later memory to a greater degree than restudying the information only; this phenomenon is known as The Testing Effect (Buchin & Mulligan, 2017). This phenomenon is critical as we live in a time where academic achievement, to a great degree, determines a person’s earning potential in the workforce and, as a result, socioeconomic status. Being able to get through academic programs is critical for job opportunities and advancement in the workforce; thus, the testing effect is a phenomenon that will aid in academic achievement.

In this paper, I will explore the phenomenon of the testing effect and how it is relevant to our society (Chan & McDermott, 2007). I will also discuss the uncertainty behind the experiment and the details of the experimental design for the replication. 

Clear phenomena description, and debrief background on research on the phenomena.

The article describes how different encoding conditions impact a person's ability to retrieve information well. This study showed that the retrieval condition improved final recall versus the non-retrieval condition (Buchin & Mulligan, 2017). The results also showed that distractions during the encoding conditions harmed final recall in both retrial and non-retrieval trials. 

Description of the to-be-replicated experiment and its relationship to the phenomena theory.

There were three phases of the study to test The Testing Effect. In phase one, titled the study phase, participants were presented with word pairs to learn; they were instructed that they would be tested on them further in the experiment (Anderson, Craik & Naveh-Benjamin, 1998). The second phase had participants either restudy the material or restudy with aspects of retrieval; both these trials were given with and without noise distractions; thus, the participants were presented with audio distractions in the second phase before the final memory recall test (Chan & McDermott, 2007). The results showed that phase two participants performed better on final recall when the restudy involved active retrieval without distractions.

This replicated study is related to the phenomenon of the testing effect because it was tested against a controlled trial, and the testing effect participants scored better than non Testing Effect participants on active recall of the word pairs (Buchin & Mulligan, 2017).

Evaluate the ‘stakes’ of the replication (i.e., what is the importance of replicating this experiment?

To improve literacy and academic achievement for society as a whole. Proving that the testing effect significantly impacts learning and memory will shape how information is taught in schools, which will, in turn, elevate academic achievement and learning (Buchin & Mulligan, 2017). 


Evaluate the ‘uncertainty' of the replication.

The uncertainty of the experiments is whether the results are transferable to everyday learning outside the testing environment.

Describe your replication:

       (i) Hypothesis.

There will be greater memory recall from participants when the word pairs incorporated the testing effect with low distractions. 

       (ii) Discuss similarities and differences between your replication and the original study.

The difference between the replication and the original study is that the replication incorporated a 100% online format, while the original study had components that require the participants to be in-person.

Similarities were that both experiments tested for the same phenomenon, measuring the effectiveness of the testing effect on active recall with and without distractions. Another similarity was that each word pair had a slight association; for example, the word pair ‘child-mother.’

       (ii) Discuss the suitability of online data collection for this experimental design.

The replication is very suitable for online study as all components can be effectively completed on the computer without an experimenter being present (Chan & McDermott, 2007). With the experiment being on a reliable server, potential experimental candidates would only need to receive the experiment link in an email with instructions. 

Method

Participants (describe the characteristics of the intended participants)

The intended participants are males and females with average memory recall ability, ages 18 to 45. These participants would not need to have prior experimental experience.

Procedures (describe the procedures for data collection) 

The data was collected by the participants entering the associated word in a text box. The first word in the word pair was given, and the participants were instructed to recall the second word from the previous study and retrieval trials (Chan & McDermott, 2007). The participants are asked to budget 6 seconds per word pair. The jsPysch plugin wouldn’t allow single questions (word trials) per page; thus, instead, a time of 6 minutes was given to recall all 60 words.

Experimental Design (describe the experimental design)

The study includes multiple within-subjects manipulations with three phases: studying, restudy, retrieval, distractions, and recall (memory test).

4.     Dependent Measures (describe the dependent measures of the experiment)

The dependent measure of the experimental design is the number of words that were accurately recalled during the memory test phase and the amount of time it took to accomplish the total recall.
